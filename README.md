## Project Setup

### Frontend

The frontend of the application is built using React, which provides a simple interface for uploading PDF files and displaying the summarized text.

### Backend

The backend is developed with Flask, which handles file uploads and processes the document using the GPT-2 model for summarization. PyMuPDF is used to extract text from PDF files.

### Dependencies

- **Frontend**: React, HTML, CSS, JavaScript
- **Backend**: Flask, PyMuPDF, PyTorch, Transformers, Flask-CORS
- **Docker**: Used for containerization to ensure consistency across environments

## Instructions to Run Locally

To run the application locally without Docker, you'll need to set up the frontend and backend separately. Ensure you have Node.js, Python, and the required libraries installed on your system.

### Frontend

1. **Navigate to the `frontend` directory**:

   ```bash
   cd frontend
2. **Install dependencies**:

    ```bash
  npm install
3. **Run the React app**:
  
  '''bash
  npm start
  ***The frontend should now be running at http://localhost:3000.**

### Backend
1. **Navigate to the backend directory:**

  '''bash
  cd backend
2. **Create a virtual environment (optional but recommended):**

  '''bash
  python -m venv venv
  venv\Scripts\activate
3. **Install dependencies:**
  
  '''bash
  pip install -r requirements.txt
4. **Run the Flask app:**

  '''bash
  flask run
  **The backend should now be running at http://localhost:5000**

## Docker Setup

To run the application using Docker, follow these steps:
### Build and start the Docker containers:
Open a terminal in the root directory of the project and run:

'''bash
docker-compose up --build
# This command will build the Docker images and start the containers for both the frontend and backend services.

Access the Application:

The frontend will be available at http://localhost:3000.
The backend will run on http://localhost:5000.


### Testing the Application
Open your browser and navigate to http://localhost:3000.
Upload a PDF file using the interface provided.
Receive the summarized text generated by the application.
